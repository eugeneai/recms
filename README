ReCMS is a CMS based on the excellent Pyramid framework that uses MongoDB for persistence and ElasticSearch, you know, for search.

It's a work in progress, but already supports:

* hierarchical folders of content (an example Article type is included; new types are easy to define and register)
* CRUD and folder operations (cut, copy, paste, rename), all with history logging
* basic publishing workflow
* a trash folder for deleted content
* edit history compare and revert
* user management, groups and local roles
* and of course full text search

Setup instructions coming soon...
