<h1>Help - History</h1>
<p>
The linked timestamps and checkboxes on this page allow you to access the edit history of this content object.
</p>
<p>
Clicking a timestamp will show you what this object would have looked like at that time given its edit history.
It <strong>does not</strong> take into account non-edit events (renames, deletes, etc.), nor does it take into account the edit history of other objects (including children).
</p>
<p>
The Diff button allows you to see the differences between the editable fields of this object at two points in time.  You can either check two times to compare, or select a single time to compare with the current values of the object.
</p>
<p>
The Revert buttons allows you to set the current values of this object's editable fields such that they match the values from an earlier point in time.  Please check only one time to revert to.
