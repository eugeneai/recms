<h1>Help - Trash</h1>
<p>
Whenever a content object is "deleted", it is not truly deleted but moved into the Trash folder.
Once a content object is in the trash, it can no longer be modified (no editing, renaming, etc.) and it is removed from the site search.  You can still view it in the trash, and a limited set of actions are available.
</p>
<h4>Restore</h4>
<p>
If you are the user who deleted an object (or you're a superuser) you may be able to restore (or "undelete") the object.  Check the boxes beside each trashed object you wish to restore, then press the Restore button.  The system will alert you if restoration is not possible.  There are a number of reasons why that may be the case, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The folder from which the object was deleted may itself have been deleted.</li>
  <li>The folder may contain a new object with the same name.</li>
  <li>You may no longer have permission to add objects to the folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Even if restoration is no longer possible, you can still try to Copy and Paste, as described in the next section.
</p>
<h4>Copy</h4>
<p>
Just as in a normal folder, you can Copy trashed objects to your paste buffer.  You can even navigate into trashed folders and copy subobjects.  You can then navigate into a folder where you have permission to add content and paste the objects as usual.
</p>
<h4>Delete</h4>
<p>
Only superusers have access to the delete action.  Please use this with care.  Once you delete an object from the trash it is truly gone for good.
